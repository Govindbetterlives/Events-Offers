# App Dashboard

### App Dashboard

After logging in to our App Dashboard, you can set up your Vision and Mission section by clicking on "Edit". Then, save or cancel the changes made. You can also view the status of your Yearly, quarterly (Q1 to Q4), and Department OKRs. Here you can maximize and minimize the Main Menu and the Logo as well.
